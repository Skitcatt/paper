# Title
Recordings of hamburger diameters at common highstreet fast-food outlets

# Introduction
We present the measurements of the varying diameters of burgers purchased from an array of common highstreet fast-food outlets.
This is in order to properly inform customers of potential value for money (McDonald et al 2004).
King et al (1998) conducted several studies in this area revealing potential savings during midnight hunger cravings on a night out can be substantial.

# Simulations
We simulate the changes in relish to burger surface area ratio according to the model by Wendy.S.

# Methodology
We compared simulations from Castle et al with our measurements.
